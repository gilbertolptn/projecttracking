# Welcome Project Tracking using EmberJS

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/gilbertolptn/projecttracking/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Installation

You can install EmberJS in your Linux distribution using:

`npm install -g ember-cli`

Maybe you should update npm using:

`npm update -g`

## Creating a new project

Amber-cli help us making all the basic setup:

`ember new project-tracking`

Changing directory:

`cd project-tracking`

Remember, angular-cli is a fork from amber-cli. So, you can run ember serve:

ember serve
